# defold-hexagon

This is the backup and library module for Defold, based on the hexagon [Lua implementation](https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/codegen/output/lib.lua) by [Red Blob Games](https://www.redblobgames.com/). You can find the original implementation [here](https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/codegen/output/lib.lua).

All credits go to [Red Blob Games](https://x.com/redblobgames).
